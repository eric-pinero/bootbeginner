                    <h3>What can I use Bootbeginner to fund?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Bootbeginner is specifically for creative footwear projects in the 
                        following categories: Sneakers, Boots, Clogs, Flats, Heels, and Loafers.

                    <h3>Who can I get pledges from?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Many of people visit Bootbeginner every week, but support always 
                        begins with people you know. Friends, fans, and the communities 
                        youâ€™re a part of  will likely be some of your earliest supporters, 
                        not to mention your biggest resources for spreading the 
                        word about your project.

                    <h3>How much work is it to run a project?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Every Bootbeginner project has its share of exhilarating and 
                        challenging moments, but the amount of work generally depends on the 
                        size and complexity of the project.
                        <br/>
                        Expect the first few days after launch to be very busy as you 
                        spread the word to your community, answer questions from potential 
                        backers, and more. You may need to spend the last few days 
                        rallying your social networks in order to reach your funding goal.
                        <br/>
                        Projects sometimes take on a life of their own, and in that case 
                        you should expect to spend more time creating and fulfilling rewards.
