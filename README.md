#### Projects:

Every project must has a minimum of the following to be created
* Category - The type of footwear to which the project is related
* Subtitle - A short description of what the project is about
* Location - The country in which the project is based

At that point the user is free to edit and add additional information
* Rewards - What backers will receive for backing the project
* Title - The main title of the project
* Funding Goal - The dollar amount that the project is trying to reach
* Campaign Duration - The number of days the campaign will run
* Story - A detailed description of the project
* Risks and Challenges - Potential issues that the project may encounter after launching that could affect the ability to deliver

All fields must be complete before a project can be launched.

The creator can use the preview button to see how their project page will appear to users after it has launched.

#### Dropdown:
Once a user has logged in, they can use the dropdown menu to view their five most recent projects. Selecting a project through the dropdown will bring the user to that project's edit page. The dropdown menu is also how users log out.
